# Introduction

The goal of the `Protein Translation` exercise is to transform an input string representing mRNA [codons][codons] to a `list` of corresponding [amino acid][amino acids] names.

There are many different ways to solve this problem in Python, but all solutions use some form of mapping that connects three-letter codon codes to their amino acid names.
The most common mapping is to use a dictionary, but [`Enums`][enums]
