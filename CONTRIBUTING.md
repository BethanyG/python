<br>

Hi. &nbsp;👋🏽 &nbsp;👋 &nbsp; **We are happy you are here.**&nbsp; 🎉🌟

Thank you so much for your interest in contributing!

**`exercsim/Python`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Python *exercises* currently under development or implemented & available for students.

 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track exercises support Python `3.9` syntax & earlier (_Python`2.x` is [deprecated][python2-sunset]_).  
 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Python `3.10` can be used to solve exercises, but features [new in `3.10`][new-in-3.10] are not supported.  
 🌟 &nbsp;&nbsp;Track tooling (_test-runner, representer, analyzer, and CI_) runs on Python `3.9`.

Exercises are grouped into **concept** exercises which teach the [Python syllabus][python-syllabus], and **practice** exercises, which are unlocked by progressing in the syllabus tree &nbsp;🌴 &nbsp;. Concept exercises are constrained to a small set of language or syntax features. Practice exercises are open-ended, and can be used to practice concepts learned, try out new techniques, and _play_.  These two exercise groupings can be found in the track [config.json][config-json], and under the `python/exercises` directory.

If you have not already done so, please take a moment to read our 🌟🌟&nbsp; [Code of Conduct][exercism-code-of-conduct].&nbsp;🌟🌟&nbsp;  
It might also be helpful to look at [Being a Good Community Member][being-a-good-community-member] & [The words that we use][the-words-that-we-use], and [Pull Requests][prs].

<table>
<td>

- _**spaces**_, never `Tabs`
- **4 space** indentation
- **120 character per line limit** (_as opposed to the default limit of 79_)
- Variable, function, and method names should be `lower_case_with_underscores` (_aka "snake case"_)
- Classes should be named in `TitleCase` (_aka "camel case"_)
- **No single letter variable names** outside of a `lambda`.  This includes loop variables and comprehensions.
- Refrain from putting `list`, `tuple`, `set`, or `dict` members on their own lines.
  Fit as many data members as can be easily read on one line, before wrapping to a second.
- If a data structure spreads to more than one line and a break (_for clarity_) is needed, prefer breaking after the opening bracket.
- Avoid putting closing brackets on their own lines. Prefer closing a bracket right after the last element.
- Use **`'`** and not **`"`** as the quote character by default.
- Use **`"""`** for docstrings.
- Prefer [implicit line joining][implicit-line-joining] for long strings.
- Prefer enclosing imports in **`()`**, and putting each on their own line when importing multiple methods.
- Two lines between `Classes`, one line between `functions`.  Other vertical whitespace as needed to help readability.
- Always use an **`EOL`** to end a file.

- [Unittest.TestCase][unittest] syntax, with [PyTest][pytest] as a test runner.
  - We are transitioning to using more PyTest features/syntax, but are leaving `Unittest` syntax in place where possible.
  - Always check with a maintainer before introducing a PyTest feature into your tests.
- Test **Classes** should be titled `<ExerciseSlug>Test`. **e.g.** `class CardGamesTest(unittest.TestCase):`
- Test method names should begin with `test_`.  Try to make test case names descriptive but not too long.
- Favor [_parameterizing_][distinguishing-test-iterations] tests that only vary input data. Use [unittest.TestCase.subTest][subtest] for parameterization.
  - An [example from Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile].
  - A second [example from Card Games][card-games-testfile].
- Avoid excessive line breaks or indentation - particularly in parameterized tests.
  - Excessive breaks & indentation within the `for` loops cause issues when formatting the test code for display on the website.
- Use [`enumerate()`][enumerate] where possible when indexes are needed. See [Card Games][card-games-testfile] for example usage.
- Favor using names like `inputs`, `data`, `input_data`, `test_data`, or `test_case_data` for test inputs.
- Favor using names like `results`, `expected`, `result_data`, `expected_data`, or `expected_results` for test outcomes.
- Favor putting the assert failure message outside of `self.assert()`. Name it `failure_msg`.  See [Card Games][card-games-testfile] for example usage.
- Favor `f-strings` for dynamic failure messages.  Please make your error messages as relevant and human-readable as possible.
- We relate test cases to **task number** via a custom [PyTest Marker][pytestmark].
  - These take the form of `@pytest.mark.task(taskno=<task-number-here>)`. See [Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile] for an example.
- We prefer **test data files** when test inputs/outputs are verbose.
  - These should be named with `_data` or `_test_data` at the end of the filename, and saved alongside the test case file.
  - See the [Cater-Waiter][cater-waiter] exercise directory for an example of this setup.
  - **Test data files** need to be added under an `editor` key within [`config.json "files"`][exercise-config-json].
  - Check with a maintainer if you have questions or issues, or need help with an exercise `config.json`.
- For new test files going forward, omit `if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()`.
- Lint with both `flake8` and `pylint`.
  - Both linters are known to toss false-positives for some testing patterns.
  - Where necessary, deploy the [`#noqa`][flake8-noqa] or [`#pylint disable=<check-name>`][pylint-disable-check] comments to suppress false-positive warnings.   - See **line 16** of [Guido's Gorgeous Lasagna][guidos-gorgeous-lasagna-testfile] test file for an example of an override.

If you have any questions or issues, don't hesitate to ask the maintainers -- they're always happy to help&nbsp;💛&nbsp;💙&nbsp;

Some of our code is old and does not (yet) conform to all these standards.  
_**We know it, and trust us, we are working on fixing it.**_ But if you see &nbsp;👀&nbsp; something, &nbsp;👄&nbsp; say something. It will motivate us to fix it! 🌈✨

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Python Versions</h2></p>

<br>

This track officially supports Python = `3.9` and earlier (_but Python 2.x is [deprecated][python2-sunset]_)
The track `test runner`, `analyzer`, and `representer` run in [docker][docker] on `python:3.9-slim`.

-  All exercises should be written for compatibility with Python = `3.8` or `3.9`.
-  While students and contributors can use Python `3.10`, features [new in `3.10`][new-in-3.10] are **not** supported.
-  Version backward _incompatibility_ (*e.g* an exercise using a `3.8` or `3.9` **only** feature)  should be clearly noted in any exercise hits, links, introductions or other notes.

-  Here is an example of how the Python documentation handles [version-tagged &nbsp;🏷&nbsp;][version-tagged-language-features] feature introduction.

- _Most_ exercises will work with Python `3.6+`, and _many_ are compatible with Python `2.7+`.
  - Please do not change existing exercises to add new language features without consulting with a maintainer first.
  - We &nbsp;💛&nbsp;💙&nbsp; modern Python, but we _also_ want to avoid student confusion when it comes to which Python versions support brand-new features.

- All test suites and example solutions must work in all Python versions that we currently support. When in doubt about a feature, please check with maintainers.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>A Little More on Exercises</h2></p>

<br>

- Each exercise must be self-contained. Please do not use or reference files that reside outside the given exercise directory. "Outside" files will not be included if a student fetches the exercise via the Command line Interface.

- Each exercise/problem should include
  - a complete test suite,
  - an example/exemplar solution,
  - a stub file ready for student implementation.

- For specifications, refer to the links below, depending on which type of exercise you are contributing to.
  - [Concept Exercise Anatomy][concept-exercise-anatomy]
  - [Practice Exercise Anatomy][practice-exercise-anatomy]

- **Practice exercise**, descriptions and instructions come from a centralized, cross-track  [problem specifications][problem-specifications] repository.
  - Any updates or changes need to be proposed/approved in `problem-specifications` first.
  - If Python-specific changes become necessary, they  need to be appended to the canonical instructions by creating a `instructions.append.md` file in this (`exercism/Python`) repository.

- Practice Exercise **Test Suits** for many practice exercises are similarly [auto-generated](#auto-generated-files) from data in [problem specifications][problem-specifications].
  - Any changes to them need to be proposed/discussed in the `problem-specifications` repository and approved by **3 track maintainers**, since changes could potentially affect many (_or all_) exercism language tracks.
  - If Python-specific test changes become necessary, they can be appended to the exercise `tests.toml` file.
  - 📛&nbsp;[ **Please file an issue**][open-an-issue]&nbsp;📛 &nbsp;and check with maintainers before adding any Python-specific tests.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>External Libraries and Dependencies</h2></p>

<br>

Our tooling (_runners, representers, and analyzers_) runs in isolated containers within the exercism website.  Because of this isolation, exercises cannot rely on third-party or external libraries.  Any library needed for an exercise or exercise tests must be incorporated as part of a tooling build, and noted for students who are using the CLI to solve problems locally.

If your exercise depends on a third-party library (_aka not part of standard Python_), please consult with maintainers about it.  We may or may not be able to accommodate the package.

<br>
<img id="auto-generated-files" align="left" width="85" height="80" src="https://github.com/exercism/website-icons/blob/main/exercises/forth.svg">
<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Auto-Generated Test Files and Test Templates</h2></p>

<br>

[**Practice exercises**][practice-exercise-files] inherit their definitions from the [problem-specifications][problem-specifications] repository in the form of _description files_.  Exercise introductions, instructions and (_in the case of **many**, but not **all**_) test files are then machine-generated for each language track.

Changes to practice exercise _specifications_ should be raised/PR'd in  [problem-specifications][problem-specifications] and approved by **3 track maintainers**. After an exercise change has gone through that process , related documents and tests for the Python track will need to be [re-generated](#generating-practice-exercise-documents) via [configlet][configlet]. Configlet is also used as part of the track CI, essential track and exercise linting, and other verification tasks.

If a practice exercise has an auto-generated `<exercise_slug>_test.py` file, there will be a  `.meta/template.j2` and a `.meta/tests.toml` file  in the exercise directory. If an exercise implements  Python track-specific tests, there may be a `.meta/additional_tests.json` to define them. These `additional_tests.json` files will automatically be included in test generation.

_Exercise Structure with Auto-Generated Test Files_

```Graphql
[<exercise-slug>/
├── .docs

├── .meta

│   ├── example.py
│   ├── template.j2
│   └── tests.toml
├── <exercise_slug>.py #stub file
└── <exercise_slug_test.py #test file
```
<br>

Practice exercise `<exercise_slug>_test.py` files are  generated/regenerated via the [Python Track Test Generator][python-track-test-generator].  
Please reach out to a maintainer if you need any help with the process.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Practice Exercise Tests</h2></p>
<br>

If an unimplemented exercise has a `canonical-data.json` file in the [problem-specifications] repository, a generation template must be created. See the Python track [test generator documentation][python-track-test-generator] for more information.

If an unimplemented exercise does not have a `canonical-data.json` file, the test file must be written manually.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Practice Exercise Example Solutions</h2></p>
<br>

**Example solution files serve two purposes only:**
1. Verification of the tests
2. Example implementation for mentor/student reference

Unlike `concept` exercise, practice exercise `example.py` files are **NOT** intended as as a "best practice" or "standard".  
They are provided as proof that there is an acceptable and testable answer to the practice exercise.

<p vertical-align="middle"><h2>Implementing Track-specific Practice Exercises</h2></p>
<br>

Implementing Track-specific Practice Exercises is similar to implementing a `canonical` exercise that has no `canonical-data.json`. But in addition to the tests, the exercise documents (_instructions, etc._) will also need to be written manually. Carefully follow the structure of generated exercise documents and the [exercism practice exercise specification][practice-exercises].
